# Wallet Encryption Module

This module provides secure wallet encryption functionality for blockchain applications using industry-standard cryptographic algorithms.

## Features

- **AES-256-CBC Encryption**: Industry-standard symmetric encryption algorithm
- **PBKDF2 Key Derivation**: Secure password-based key derivation with 100,000 iterations
- **Random Salt Generation**: Unique salt for each encryption operation
- **Initialization Vector (IV)**: Random IV for each encryption to ensure security
- **Import/Export**: Easily export encrypted wallets and import them later
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for invalid inputs and decryption failures
- **Send with Locking**: Outgoing transfers blocked by a global kill-switch and per-wallet lock/pause controls

## Installation

The wallet module is included in the project. No additional dependencies are required beyond Node.js built-in `crypto` module.

## Usage

### Basic Example

```javascript
const Wallet = require('./src/wallet');

// Create a new wallet instance
const wallet = new Wallet();

// Generate a new wallet
const walletData = wallet.generate();
console.log('Address:', walletData.address);

// Encrypt the wallet with a password
const password = 'MySecurePassword123!';
const encryptedData = wallet.encrypt(password);
console.log('Wallet encrypted successfully');

// Export the encrypted wallet
const exported = wallet.export();

// Import and decrypt
const newWallet = new Wallet();
newWallet.import(exported);
const decrypted = newWallet.decrypt(password);
console.log('Wallet decrypted successfully');
```

### Running the Demo

Run the included example to see the wallet encryption in action:

```bash
npm run wallet:demo
```

## API Reference

### `wallet.generate()`

Generates a new wallet with a random private key and address.

**Returns:** `{ address: string, privateKey: string }`

### `wallet.encrypt(newPassword)`

Encrypts the wallet with the provided password.

**Parameters:**
- `newPassword` (string): Password to encrypt the wallet (minimum 8 characters)

**Returns:** Encrypted wallet data object containing:
- `data`: Encrypted wallet data (hex string)
- `salt`: Random salt used for key derivation (hex string)
- `iv`: Initialization vector (hex string)
- `algorithm`: Encryption algorithm used ('aes-256-cbc')
- `kdf`: Key derivation function ('pbkdf2')
- `iterations`: Number of PBKDF2 iterations (100000)

**Throws:** Error if password is invalid or too short

### `wallet.decrypt(password)`

Decrypts the wallet using the provided password.

**Parameters:**
- `password` (string): Password to decrypt the wallet

**Returns:** Decrypted wallet data object containing:
- `address`: Wallet address
- `privateKey`: Wallet private key
- `timestamp`: Encryption timestamp

**Throws:** Error if password is incorrect or data is corrupted

### `wallet.export()`

Exports the encrypted wallet data.

**Returns:** Encrypted wallet data object

**Throws:** Error if wallet has not been encrypted

### `wallet.import(encryptedData)`

Imports encrypted wallet data.

**Parameters:**
- `encryptedData` (object): Previously exported encrypted wallet data

**Throws:** Error if encrypted data is invalid

### `wallet.clearSensitiveData()`

**NEW (February 2026)** - Clears sensitive data (private keys) from memory.

**Security Note:** Call this method when you're done using the wallet to minimize exposure of private keys in memory. While JavaScript's garbage collection limits the effectiveness of memory wiping, this provides a best-effort approach to clear sensitive data.

**Usage:**
```javascript
const wallet = new Wallet();
wallet.generate();
// ... use the wallet ...
wallet.clearSensitiveData(); // Clear private key from memory
```

**Note:** This method only clears the private key. Address and encrypted data are preserved as they are less sensitive.

### `wallet.lock()`

Locks the wallet to prevent any outgoing sends. Clears the private key from memory for security.

After locking, call `wallet.unlock(password)` to restore access.

### `wallet.unlock(password)`

Unlocks the wallet by decrypting it with the stored password.

**Parameters:**
- `password` (string): The password previously used to encrypt the wallet

**Throws:** Error if the password is incorrect or no encrypted data is available

### `wallet.pause(callerAddress)`

Pauses outgoing sends without clearing the private key (owner only).

**Parameters:**
- `callerAddress` (string): Must match the wallet's `ownerAddress`

**Throws:** Error if caller is not the owner or the wallet has not been generated

### `wallet.unpause(callerAddress)`

Resumes outgoing sends (owner only).

**Parameters:**
- `callerAddress` (string): Must match the wallet's `ownerAddress`

**Throws:** Error if caller is not the owner or the wallet has not been generated

### `wallet.send(to, amount)`

Sends funds to a recipient address. **Throws if the global lock, per-wallet lock, or pause is active.**

**Parameters:**
- `to` (string): Recipient wallet address
- `amount` (number|string): Amount to send (must be a positive number)

**Returns:** Transaction details object containing:
- `from`: Sender wallet address
- `to`: Recipient address
- `amount`: Numeric amount
- `timestamp`: Transaction timestamp

**Throws:** Error if any lock is active, recipient is invalid, or amount is not a positive number

**Usage:**
```javascript
const tx = wallet.send('0xRecipientAddress...', 0.5);
console.log('Transaction:', tx);
```

### `GLOBAL_WALLET_LOCK` (exported constant)

A boolean flag that, when `true`, blocks **all** `wallet.send()` calls across every wallet instance. This is the primary kill-switch for outgoing transfers.

**Default:** `true` (all sends blocked until explicitly lifted)

**How to lift the lock:**

Option 1 – environment variable (no code change):
```bash
WALLET_GLOBAL_LOCK=false node app.js
```

Option 2 – feature flag in `feature-flags.json`:
```json
"global_wallet_lock": { "enabled": false }
```

Option 3 – code change in `src/wallet.js`:
Change the fallback value in the `GLOBAL_WALLET_LOCK` constant from `true` to `false`.

**Usage:**
```javascript
const { Wallet, GLOBAL_WALLET_LOCK } = require('./src/wallet');

if (GLOBAL_WALLET_LOCK) {
  console.log('Outgoing transfers are currently disabled.');
}
```

> **Portability:** Copy the `GLOBAL_WALLET_LOCK` constant definition and the guard at the top of `send()` to any other wallet module to instantly adopt the same lock behaviour.

## Security Considerations

⚠️ **Important Security Notes:**

1. **Never store passwords in plain text** - This is a demonstration module. In production, use secure password management.

2. **Private key security** - Private keys should never be exposed. In a real application, consider using hardware wallets or secure enclaves.

3. **Password strength** - Use strong, unique passwords with at least 12 characters including uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.

4. **Backup encrypted wallets** - Always backup your encrypted wallet data in a secure location.

5. **Transport security** - When transmitting encrypted wallet data, always use secure channels (HTTPS, TLS).

## Algorithm Details

- **Encryption Algorithm**: AES-256-CBC
- **Key Derivation Function**: PBKDF2
- **PBKDF2 Iterations**: 100,000
- **Salt Size**: 32 bytes (256 bits)
- **IV Size**: 16 bytes (128 bits)
- **Key Size**: 32 bytes (256 bits)

## Testing

The module includes a comprehensive example that demonstrates:
- Wallet generation
- Encryption with a valid password
- Export and import of encrypted data
- Successful decryption
- Failed decryption with wrong password

Run the test with:

```bash
npm run wallet:demo
```
